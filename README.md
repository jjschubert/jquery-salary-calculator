# Salary Calculator

## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

This project is a salary calculator that makes it easy to view some basic data about your employees as well as your monthly costs. If monthly costs rise too high, the site will alert the user by displaying costs in red. 

Employees can be added and deleted from the table as needed. Added employees are held as objects in an array, and removed from the array if deleted. When and employee is deleted, the monthly costs will also be updated.
